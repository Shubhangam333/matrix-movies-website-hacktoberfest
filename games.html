            Enter the Matrix is a 2003
            <span class="highlight">action-adventure video game</span> developed

            by
            <span class="highlight">Infogrames under the Atari brand name</span
            >. It was the first game based on The Matrix film series. Its story
            is <span class="highlight">concurrent</span> with that of the film
            <span class="highlight">The Matrix Reloaded</span> and features over
            an hour of <span class="highlight">original footage</span>, written
            and directed by the <span class="highlight">Wachowskis</span> and
            starring the cast of the films, produced for the game.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            <span class="highlight">Released in May 2003</span>, the same month
            as The Matrix Reloaded, Enter the Matrix was
            <span class="highlight">simultaneously</span> produced with The
            Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. While it received mixed
            reviews from critics, the game sold
            <span class="highlight">5 million copies</span> as of May 2004.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            Enter the Matrix gives players control of two of the supporting
            characters from Reloaded and Revolutions,
            <span class="highlight"
              >Ghost (Anthony Wong) and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith)</span
            >, members of the same group of rebels as Morpheus, Trinity, and
            Neo, the protagonists of the series. Niobe is the
            <span class="highlight">Captain of the Logos</span>, the fastest
            ship in the rebel fleet. Ghost is the ship's first mate, weapons
            guru, and a deep-thinking, philosophical assassin. The game takes
            place at roughly the same time as the events in Reloaded.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            Players play as either Niobe or Ghost, each of whom have slight
            variations during their story. Most levels involve controlling
            players in a
            <span class="highlight">third-person perspective</span>, using guns
            and fighting skills to defeat opponents and complete level
            objectives. At any time, players can activate
            <span class="highlight">bullet time</span> (called
            <span class="highlight">"Focus"</span> in the game) which slows down
            time, giving players the ability to perform actions such as
            <span class="highlight">shooting in midair and dodging bullets</span
            >. Some levels involve one-on-one martial arts fighting against
            single opponents. In levels involving vehicles, such as driving a
            car or piloting the Logos, the style of game play depends on the
            <span class="highlight">selected player</span>, commonly with Niobe
            maneuvering the vehicles to avoid obstacles, whilst Ghost takes
            control of a gun to fight off incoming enemies. A hacking system
            allows players to enter codes, which can unlock special skills,
            weapons and secrets, such as a 2-player versus mode.

            <span class="highlight">Wachowskis</span>, who wrote and directed
            the first three The Matrix films and the 2003 video game Enter the
            Matrix, also developed by Shiny Entertainment. Players control the
            character <span class="highlight">Neo</span>, participating in
            scenes from the films. The game received mixed reviews from critics.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            The Matrix: Path of Neo allows the player to participate in many of
            the <span class="highlight">major action scenes in the films</span>.
            Most of these sequences, picked by the movie directors themselves,
            are taken from the first film in the series.
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            At the start of the game, the player is hacker
            <span class="highlight">Thomas Anderson</span>, and does not possess
            any of the powers that the character will later discover as Neo. He
            has to find his way through by
            <span class="highlight">stealth and basic brawl</span>. As the game
            continues, players learn new skills and techniques, equipping Neo
            for the final showdown with Agent Smith. These
            <span class="highlight">additional skills</span> may be
            <span class="highlight">level</span> and in the main game. Many of
            these skills are used by Neo in the trilogy, including the
            <span class="highlight">bullet dodge, bullet stop, and flight</span
            >. A number of weapons are available in the game, consisting of both
            <span class="highlight">melee weapons</span> (including various
            types of swords, staves, and escrimas) and
            <span class="highlight">firearms</span> (assault rifle, sub-machine
            gun, pistol etc.).
          </p>
          <p class="para">
            The game also allows the player to meet many of the characters in
            the films, including
            <span class="highlight">Trinity, Morpheus and the Merovingian</span
            >, among others. The game uses
            <span class="highlight">film excerpts</span> as cut scenes
            throughout the game at certain milestones. This footage includes
            clips from the
            <span class="highlight">original The Matrix theatrical films</span>,
            and from other sources, including the short film series,
            <span class="highlight">The Animatrix and Enter the Matrix</span>.
            The PC & Xbox versions also lack certain visual effects compared to
            the PS2 version such as the image warping.

            Released during the 2021 Game Awards on
            <span class="highlight">December 9, 2021</span>, it features Trinity
            (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Neo (Keanu Reeves), along with
            <span class="highlight">photorealistic 3D-scanned models</span> of
            both Moss and Reeves from the present time, portrayed by themselves,
            in cinematic and QTE shooter scenes where the player can take

            While the

            released the city environment in the demo as a
            <span class="highlight">sample project titled "City Sample"</span>
            in their Unreal Engine 5 workshop. This was immediately used by fans
            to generate a Windows executable package in which the city can be
            navigated. It offered the ability to control several parameters of
            the game engine. The game also features
            <span class="highlight">NPCs with AI</span> that will generate
            conversations when players use the audio. The assets were also
            reused later in several fan-made demos featuring characters such as
            Spider-Man and Batman.
